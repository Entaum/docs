  )}

Next, let's name the integration in step 3. You will use this name to
identify the integration when attaching it to devices.

## Connecting Integrations to Devices

Devices are connected to integrations through the use of Labels. Labels are
named identifiers, that can be used to associate an integration with a device.
To connect one or more devices to one or more integrations, simply attach the
same label to both the device and integration. Labels need to be created before
attaching them to devices and integrations. Read more on this [here](../labels).
